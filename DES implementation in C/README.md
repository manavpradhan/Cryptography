Data Encryption Standard (DES) is a symmetric-key algorithm for the encryption of electronic data. Although now considered insecure, it was highly influential in the advancement of modern cryptography.

__INPUT FILES TO THE PROGRAM –__

- input.txt- WILL CONTAIN OUR PLAIN TEXT (Max. Limit of plain text is 64kb).
- key.txt - WILL CONTAIN 64-BIT KEY (take below key)
```
0001001100110100010101110111100110011011101111001101111111110001
```

__OUTPUT FILE –__

- result.txt – IT WILL CONTAIN OUR DECRYPTED TEXT.

__TEMP FILES –__

- bits.txt – IT WILL CONTAIN OUR PLAIN TEXT CONVERTED IN BITS.
- cipher.txt – IT WILL CONTAIN OUR ENCRYPTED TEXT IN BITS.
- decrypted.txt – IT WILL CONTAIN OUR DECRYPTED TEXT IN BITS (SAME AS bits.txt IN CONTENT)


_Above program is tested in Windows environment using Code::Blocks 16.01._
